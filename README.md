# Career Transition Analytics

This repository contains a ready‑to‑use analytics project designed for aspiring business analysts, program managers and data analysts. It provides a structured example of how to explore, visualize and model data for career transition scenarios. The project uses a **synthetic dataset** that mimics real‑world patterns, ensuring privacy while showcasing technical skills.

## Repository Contents

- **`career_transition_dataset.csv`** – A synthetic dataset of 200 records describing individual career transitions, including demographic information, skills, industry changes, salary changes and outcomes.
- **`career_transition_analysis.ipynb`** – A Jupyter notebook with exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations and predictive models (logistic regression and random forest classifiers for classifying successful transitions, plus a linear regression model for predicting salary change percentage).
- **`requirements.txt`** – A list of Python dependencies needed to run the notebook.
- **`README.md`** – This file.

## Dataset Overview

Each row in **`career_transition_dataset.csv`** represents an individual seeking or undergoing a career change. The columns include:

| Column | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Age` | Age of the individual (22–60 years). |
| `Education` | Highest education level (High School, Bachelor, Master, PhD). |
| `YearsExperience` | Total years of work experience. |
| `CurrentIndustry` | Industry of the current job (e.g. IT, Finance, Healthcare). |
| `NewIndustry` | Industry of the new/desired job. |
| `SalaryDiffPct` | Percentage change in salary (negative means a decrease). |
| `Certification` | Whether the individual holds a professional certification (1 = Yes, 0 = No). |
| `SoftSkillsScore` | Soft skills rating from 1 to 10. |
| `HardSkillsScore` | Technical skills rating from 1 to 10. |
| `ManagerialExperience` | Managerial experience indicator (1 = Yes, 0 = No). |
| `ProgramInvolvement` | Cross‑functional program involvement indicator (1 = Yes, 0 = No). |
| `TimeToTransitionMonths` | Number of months taken to transition to the new role. |
| `SuccessfulTransition` | Indicator of whether the transition was successful (1 = Success, 0 = Failure). |

This dataset is entirely synthetic: it was generated by combining random sampling with simple statistical relationships among features. Consequently, it is free of personal or confidential data and can be shared publicly.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the contents as a ZIP).

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shreyapatil9480/career-transition-analytics.git
   cd career-transition-analytics
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended) and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch the notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook career_transition_analysis.ipynb
   ```

   This will open Jupyter in your browser. Run each cell sequentially to reproduce the exploratory analysis and modeling steps.

## Project Highlights

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizes age distribution, education levels, industry distributions and correlation heatmaps.
- **Predictive Modeling** – Uses logistic regression and random forest classifiers to estimate the probability of a successful transition. Also includes a simple linear regression for predicting salary change percentage.
- **Best Practices** – Demonstrates data preprocessing, train/test splitting and model evaluation with accuracy scores and classification reports.
